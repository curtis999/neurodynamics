Recordings have shown that spiking in sensory systems correlates with features of the stimulus and maps have been constructed in which the spiking in regions has been linked to specific aspects of the environment.  Deeper in brain, spiking of populations of neurons seems to correspond to more abstract mental phenomena: recognition, decisions, attraction etc.\n",

Injury to one region can damage a particular memory type while leaving the rest intact. It is generally accepted that memory formation corresponds to synaptic changes but how memories are recorded and stored is still unknown.  (Ex. When we memorize a song we remember the separations between the notes rather than the notes themselves.)\n",
